# AppSecAssignment1.1
Hello students! In this assignment you will be fixing a barely-fuctioning 
and deeply-flawed C program used to create a gift card file. Details 
about this assignment can be found in the 
[Instructions File](./HW1_Instructions.md).

Please remember to turn in both the code and a write-up. The write-up
should be **no longer than 3 pages** and should explain:

1. Your method to try to find bugs.
2. Your method to try to fix the bugs you found (if any).
3. Your method of writing tests and fuzzing.

This write-up is very useful for partial credit, just in case you did 
not do as well in the actual goals of the assignment as you were 
expecting or hoping.

Good luck!
